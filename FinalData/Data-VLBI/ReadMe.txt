We used 9 EVN GROUND-BASED stations :

EF, HH, JB, NT, ON, TR, YS, WB, SH. The longest baseline here is ~10161Km and the shortest baseline is
~267Km. 

We sampled the uv domain during 0.001s time step during a period  4.75s at 16GHz, this resulting to 4750 timeslots. Each timeslots has a total bandwidth of 150KHz channelized into 300 channels each of width 500Hz. 

The data :


1- pickle-0.01s-bw12.5KHz.data : resampled 0.01s in time and 12.5KHz in frequency

	

2- pickle-0.1s-bw25KHz.data: resampled 0.1s in time and 25KHz in frequency

3-pickle-0.25s-bw25KHz.dataP resampled 0.25s in time and 25KHz in frequency


############ Please use the radius in pickle-0.01s-bw12.5KHz.data to plot all averaging
