Results for 1MhZ re-sampling frequency channels widths, for all integrations (25s,50s,100s) and all overlap (sinc-3x2, sinc-4x3). The pipe line will be push very soon, if you want to run something by your self.


The pdf "data_structure.pdf" tell you how the data is structure in the pickle file.


The total plots you can make from this data is 30 plots for 1Mhz. So we are going to have 30*2 for 2Mhz and 4Mhz
