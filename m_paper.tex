\begin{abstract}
This paper investigates the use of baseline dependent windowing functions in interferometry data to minimize the loss of 
signal amplitude (smearing) when the correlated data is averaged over wide bandwidth and long time. In radio interferometry smearing is 
reduced when a cross-correlator averages the correlated data over narrower bandwidth and shorter integration times. Unfortunately, this 
leads to a huge amount of data to manage and it is becoming a bottleneck for further data processing such as calibration and 
imaging.  With future generation surveys, it is important to investigate the reduction of the output data rate. Therefore, the focus of 
this paper is on the use of baselines dependent windowing functions to keep smearing down at an acceptable extent and at the same time 
significantly suppress signals 
from out field of view sources, while the nominal sensitivity is conserved.

\section[]{Introduction}
The recent radio astronomy techniques is to build a single, gigantic instrument called \textit{interferometer}, from the combination of 
several small parabolic antennas separated over kilometres (\cite{2}). The signal from each antenna is combined at the level of a 
cross-correlator to form the interferometer  data output. The cross-correlator carries out  data reduction and filters out an amount of 
noise by averaging the signal of each baseline over discrete time and/or frequency bins.
It is well known in interferometry that averaging 
can lead to the loss of signal amplitude when the cross correlator integrate over a longer period of time and a wider bandwidth. This 
effect is known as time-average smearing and bandwidth smearing (Thompson et \textit{al.} \cite{2}). The above effects cause the distortion 
of sources within the 
field of interest by decreasing their intensity.\\
To keep smearing down at acceptable levels, a correlator must cross-correlate the signal over a shorter period of time and a narrower 
bandwidth, hence producing a large amount of data for subsequence stage such as 
imaging \citep{Marti2008,Linfield1986}, calibration (\cite{2}), etc. This huge amount of data is becoming an increasingly serious 
problem 
and becoming 
more challenging as the computational demands of the next generation radio telescopes will rise significantly (see the SKA phase 1 
specification \cite{2}). 
Similarly, the next generation of radio telescopes will require an unprecedented level of SNR while mapping large regions of the sky. Thus, 
a substantial 
increase in \textit{SNR} can only be achieve by observing for longer time at wider bandwidth without loss of signal: this is not 
realisable with averaging.
Therefore, it becomes urgent to develop new decorrelation algorithm techniques that will allow the required SNR of the future radio 
telescopes.\\
In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of correlator windowing functions for the reduction of 
interferometric data and the recovery of interferometers arrays desire FoV, with the ultimate goal of reaching higher SNR. The main idea is 
to achieve a high SNR by conserving the astrophysical signal and by limiting the noise. Thermal noise can be driven arbitrary low by 
increasing the observing time\footnote{...}, but in radio astronomy confusion noise is a major problem and can even cause calibration to 
fail. Therefore, we seek to use a windowing function that will conserve the useful signal while also limiting sidelobes confusion from out 
of FoV sources.
\begin{equation}
 SNR=\frac{S_{use}}{N_{ter}+N_{con}}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item "\textit{Useful signal}", $S_{use}$ the signal from source in the field of interest. These sources should be accurately recovered
over the instrument entire FoV : correlator windowing functions maximized this signal by allowing the interferometer array to map a large 
region of the sky.
  \item "\textit{Sidelobe confusion}", $N_{con}$ signal from out field of view sources received from their  sidelobes. These sources are  
not of interest and should be removed : correlator windowing functions acts as a remover of these signals when the array is mapping a large 
region of the sky.
  \item "\textit{Thermal noise}", $N_{ter}$ the thermal noise from the instrument, ionosphere, etc. Averaging presents theoretically  a 
maximum sensitivity, but the use of extended correlator windowing functions can reduce or eliminate the loss of the nominal sensitivity.
\end{itemize}
The proposed techniques are applied to MeerKAT (Karoo Array Telescope) \cite{1} and the Very Large 
Array (VLA)\cite{1} and  could also be used for future radio telescopes such as the SKA.
\section[]{ Overviews and definitions}
\subsection{Visibility and relation with the sky }
\label{sec:visSky}
An interferometer array measured a quantity $V=V(u,v,w)$ known classically as the visibility function (see \cite{5}).
The variables $u,v$ and $w$ are in unit of wavelength and they are the coordinates of the vector of which the norm is the distance between 
two antennas, known in interferometry as a baseline. A source in the sky will see $u$ and $v$ oriented towards the direction East-West and 
South-North respectively and $w$ is directed towards the phase centre of the source plane or image plane. The projection of $u$ and $v$ in 
the image plane are $l$ and $m$ respectively. They are the observed source coordinates, measured in radian. The ideal measurement of 
interferometric wide-field imaging also known as the van Cittert-Zernike theorem (Thompson et \textit{al}. 2001, Eq.6) is given by
\begin{equation}
 V_{pq}=\int \int \frac{I(l,m)}{\sqrt{1-l^2 - m^2}}e^{-2\pi i \phi (u,v,w)}dldm, \label{eq1:visSky}
\end{equation} 
where $I(l,m)$ is the sky brightness and $\phi(u,v,w)=u.l+v.m+w.(\sqrt{1-l^2 - m^2}-1)$ is a term from the cross-correlator that models the 
direction in the sky and the separation of the two antennas. The term $\sqrt{1-l^2 - m^2}$ is the result of the projection of the celestial 
sphere on the image plane.
% 
% In the radio astronomy community, it is well known that the Radio Interferometry Measurement Equation (RIME) description well the 
% visibility equation of a pair of antennas $(p,q)$. After the generic formulation of the RIME by Hamaka et \textit{al}. (), a full sky 
% of the RIME is described mathematically by O.M. Smirnov (2010) and  it is given by
% \begin{equation}
%  V_{pq}=\textbf{G}_{p}\Bigg(\int \int B_{pq}e^{-2\pi i \big(\phi (u,v,w)-w.(\sqrt{1-l^2 - m^2}-1)\big)}dldm\Bigg)\textbf{G}_{pq}^{H}, 
% \label{eq1:visSky},
% \end{equation} 
% $B_{pq}$
\subsection{Averaging and convolution}
\label{sec:AvgCon}
The Earth rotation causes the phase, $\phi (u,v,w)$ to variate in time. The baseline 
coordinates are defined in units of wavelength, and making $\phi (u,v,w)$ to variate in frequency. 
To take this effect into account, Eq. \ref{eq1:visSky} is  rewritten as an integration over time and frequency interval. If we 
consider that $[t_s,t_e]$ is the time integration interval and $[\nu_s,\nu_e]$ the frequency integration 
interval, then Eq.\ref{eq1:visSky} can be rewritten as:
% variates in 
% time when the Earth rotation is  if $\textbf{V}_{pq}^{true}(t,\nu)$ is the non integrated visibilities observed during 
% the time interval $\Delta t$ at multi frequency  within the bandwidth $\Delta \nu$, then the cross correlate visibility, 
% $\mathcal{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{corr}$ of the  baseline $(p,q)$ is given as:
\begin{equation}
V_{pq}^{avg}=\frac{1}{\Delta t \Delta \nu} \int_{t_s}^{t_e}\int_{\nu_s}^{\nu_e}V_{pq,(t,\nu)}d\nu dt
\label{eq2:conti}
\end{equation}
 $V_{pq}$ is a continuous function, in reality we know only the sampled visibility, 
$V_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp}=S_{pq,(t,\nu)}V_{pq,(t,\nu)}$ at a specific time and frequency. $S_{pq,(t,\nu)}$ is a sampling 
function that indicates where the $(u, v)$ data for the baseline $(p,q)$ is measured  during the time and frequency integration. 
Therefore, 
Eq.\ref{eq2:conti} holds for many sources, when the signal at the centre frequency, $\nu_c$ and at the centre time, 
$t_c$ is restricted to a narrow frequency interval and to a short time interval $[t_s,t_e]$ 
respectively, this is the current efficient observing mode. However, this is expressed mathematically as 
\begin{eqnarray}
V_{pq}^{avg}&=&\frac{1}{n_t n_{\nu}}  \sum_{i=1}^{n_t}\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\nu}} S_{pq,(t_i, 
\nu_j)}V_{pq,(t_i,\nu_j)}.\label{eq2:sample}
%&=&\frac{1}{n_t n_{\nu}}  \sum_{i=1}^{n_t}\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\nu}}\mathcal{\textbf{V}}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{meas} 
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $n_t$ and $n_{\nu}$ are the number of discrete times within the time interval  and the number of discrete frequency 
within the frequency interval  respectively. For convenience, lets introduce a normalized \textit{Boxcar} windowing 
function, $\Pi_{pq,(t_c - t,\nu_c -\nu)}$  that will attribute an equal weight (in this case $1/n_t n_{\nu}$) to all sampling visibilities 
points. We can therefore rewrite Eq. \ref{eq2:sample} as:
\begin{eqnarray}
V_{pq}^{agv}&=& \sum_{i=1}^{n_t}\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\nu}}\Pi_{pq,(t_c - t_i,\nu_c -\nu_j)}S_{pq,(t_i,\nu_j)}V_{pq,(t_i,\nu_j)}\\
	    &=& \sum_{i=1}^{n_t}\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\nu}}\Pi_{pq,(t_c - t_i,\nu_c -\nu_j)}V_{pq,(t_i,\nu_j)}^{samp}. 
\label{eq:avscon}
\end{eqnarray}

It is worth noting that Eq.\ref{eq:avscon} is a naturally weighted visibility and is a two dimensional convolution between the 
\textit{Boxcar} windowing function and the sampled visibility $V_{pq}^{samp}$. Thus, averaging is equivalent to convolving the 
sampled 
visibility with a \textit{Boxcar} windowing function. Mathematically, this is described as follows:
\begin{equation}
 V_{pq}^{avg}=c_{pq,(t,\nu)}\cdot\Bigg(\Big(\Pi_{pq}\circ V_{pq}^{samp}\Big)_{(t,\nu)}\Bigg). \label{f4}
\end{equation}
Here, $c_{pq,(t,\nu)}$ is a function that samples the result of $\Big(\Pi_{pq}\circ V_{pq}^{samp}\Big)_{(t,\nu)}$ at 
the centre time interval and centre frequency interval.
\subsection{Effect of time and bandwidth averaging}
During imaging, Eq.\ref{f4} is inverse Fourier transform, and after applying the convolution theorem , the $sinc$ function ( 
$\mathcal{F}^{-1}\Pi_{pq, (t,\nu)}=sinc(\pi\Delta u_{pq}||\textbf{l}||)$) multiply the sky. Thus, the 
sky map is tapered by the $sinc$ function in the $l$ and $m$ direction, the response is maximal for sources at the phase centre ( 
$l=0,m=0$) while for off-phase centre sources, the response is smeared (decreased) for larger $\Delta u_{pq}$ ( 
$\Delta u_{pq}$ is a function of $\Delta t$ and $\Delta \nu$). The main lobe of the $sinc$ extends from 
$-1/2\Delta u_{pq}$ to $1/2\Delta u_{pq}$ while the amplitude gradually dies out, and the larger the $\Delta 
u_{pq}$, the narrower the central peak and the oscillations. Therefore, the degree of smearing increases with the position of a 
source and the baseline length (see Thompson et \textit{al}.)\footnote{The Fourier phase components $2\pi \phi(u,v,w)$ depends on the 
direction in the sky, the wavelength, the separation of antennas as well as the integration time and frequency. A maximal phase will 
occurs on longer baselines and small phase on shorter baselines.}.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Fig.\ref{timessear1} shows the attenuation of a source at various coordinates in the sky for various integration time interval. We 
measure  more than $90\%$ of the source brightness for integrations less than or equal to $25s$ when the source is within the 
       Field of view and more than $90\%$ when the source is out of the Field of View. As mention above, for small integration like $25s$ 
       we produce large data  and maintain strong sidelobes contamination from out field of view sources.
       %For a source at coordinates $(l=0, m=1deg)$ smearing occurs for an integration greater than $90s$ (see Fig.\ref{timessear11})

\end{figure*}
Fortunately, since the response is maximal only for sources at the phase centre, an interesting approach is achieved by convolving the 
observed visibility with a  windowing function that depends on $(u,v)$ coordinates spacing (baseline dependent windowing function). 
However, a windowing function with a wide dynamic range spectrum is preferable in this work.
\subsection{Imaging}
\label{sec:imaging}
From the full sky Radio Interferometry Measurement Equation (RIME) formalism (see Hamaka et \textit{al}, O.M. Smirnov (2010a)), in this 
case, the sampled visibilities can be presented mathematically as a $4\times n_t\times n_{\nu}$ matrix of four polarizations time and 
frequency dependent matrices each of size $n_t\times n_{\nu}$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp}&=&\mathcal{\textbf{S}}_{pq,(t,\nu)}\cdot\mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}\\
			      &=&\Bigg(\mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{0},\mathbf { V } 
^1_{pq,(t,\nu)},\mathbf{V}^2_{pq,(t,\nu)},\mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{3 } \Bigg)^T. \label{eqx:conv}
\end{eqnarray*}
Now, consider that $\mathcal{\textbf{W}}_{pq,(t,\nu)}$ is a $n_t \times n_{\nu}$ matrix that contained the weights of the baseline $(p,q)$ 
visibilities points. The weights of this matrix are given by a baseline dependent windowing function that we described in section 
\ref{baseline1} and section \ref{baseline2}.
The convolution operator is linear, therefore we can rewrite Eq.\ref{f4} in terms of a series of linear transformations as follow:
\begin{equation}
V_{pq}^{avg}= \mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block}\cdot 
\mathbf{S}_{pq,(t,\nu)}\cdot\mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}.\label{eqbb:linear}
\end{equation}
Here, $\mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block}$ is a block diagonal matrix of size $(4n_t n_{\nu})\times(4n_t n_{\nu})$ and the 
block elements are $\mathbf{C}_{pq,(t,\nu)}\cdot\mathcal{\textbf{W}}_{pq,(t,\nu)}$ of size $n_t\times n_{\nu}$, where 
$\mathbf{C}_{pq,(t,\nu)}$ is the centre time interval and centre frequency interval sampling matrix of size $n_t\times n_{\nu}$. This
is the result of the time and frequency integration for the baseline $(p,q)$.

For a synthesis, the baseline $(p,q)$ made a full coverage in the $(u,v)$ plane. Therefore, we can  
package into a single matrix, $\mathbf{V}_{pq,}^{avg}$ of size $(4N_t N_{\nu})\times (4N_t N_{\nu})$ the 
weighted average visibilities of the  baseline $(p,q)$ during the synthesis as follows: 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{V}_{pq}^{avg}= \mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block,n}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{n}\cdot\mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)},\label{eq2:block}
\end{equation}
where $N_t$ and  $N_{\nu}$ are the number of time sample and frequency channels entering the Fourier domain. If the synthesis time is $T$ 
and the frequency range is $F$, then $T=N_t \times \Delta t$ and $F=N_{\nu}\times\Delta \nu$. The the size of 
$\mathbf{V}_{pq}^{avg}$ can also be written as $(4N_v^{pq})\times (4N_v^{pq})$, where $N_v^{pq}$ is the 
number of time and frequency visibilities for the baseline $(p,q)$). The matrix $\mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block,n}$ is a diagonal block 
matrix of size $(4N_v^{pq}n_t n_{\nu})\times (4N_v^{pq}n_t n_{\nu})$ where each diagonal block is the block diagonal matrix 
$\mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block}$ defined above and $n$ is the number of $\mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block}$. The sampled visibilities
$\mathcal{\textbf{S}}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{n}\cdot\mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}=\textbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp,n}$ is a one row matrix of size 
$(N_v^{pq}4 n_t n_{\nu})\times (4 n_t n_{\nu})$ made of $\textbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp}$ on top of each other. 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{V}_{pq}^{avg}= \mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block,n}\cdot 
\mathbf{S}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{n}\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathcal{I}_{l,m}^{sky},\label{eqv:linear}
\end{equation}
if the number of pixel in the sky model is $N_{pix}$, then the true sky image vector $\mathcal{I}_{l,m}^{sky}$ has a size of $4N_{pix}$ and 
$\textbf{F}$ is the Fourier transform operator of size $(4N_{pix})\times(4N_{pix})$. 

We are generally interested in using the total set of visibilities over baselines, time and frequencies, having $4\times N_v$ visibilities 
measured over all baselines  and $N_v=n_{bl}\times N_v^{pq}$ in this case. Here, $n_{bl}$ is the number of baseline. We can write
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{V}_{all}^{avg}=\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathcal{I}_{l,m}^{sky}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\mathbf{A}$ is a matrix of size $(4N_v)\times (4N_{pix})$ made of 
$\mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block,n}\cdot\mathcal{S}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{n}\cdot\mathbf{F}$ on top of each other. The 
dirty image, $\mathcal{I}_{l,m}^{D}$ of size $4N_{pix}$ can then be derived
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}_{l,m}^{D}=\mathbf{F}^{H}\cdot\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathcal{I}_{l,m}^{sky}.
\end{equation}
Here, $H$ represents the the conjugate transpose operation also known as a Hermitian transpose and $\mathbf{F}^{H}$ is the inverse 
Fourier transform operator of size $(4N_{pix})\times(4N_{pix})$.

\section{Data compression algorithm}
\label{baseline1}
\subsection{Description}
Missing spaces between sampled $(u,v)$ coordinates has huge dependences on the baseline length. However, the spacing between longer 
baselines $(u,v)$ coordinates are wider then the one on shorter baselines: this explained while sources are more distorted on longer 
baselines. We aims in this section, to describe the algorithm we use with a baseline-dependent windowing function to assign a proper 
weight to a data reference by a $(u,v)$ coordinate considering the \textit{spacing}\footnote{The \textit{distance} has also huge 
dependences on the baseline length and allow us to formally define the data
weight of a $uv$ point over the entire $uv$ plane.} between the baseline $(u,v)$ coordinates.

Fig.\ref{fig:uvcov} shows a snapshot coverage of an integration interval. For shorter baselines, the tracks are closer to the centre of 
rotation and for longer baselines the tracks are farther away from this centre. The \textit{dot marks} are the data for a sampled $(u,v)$ 
data, and the  arrows indicates the separation between $(u,v)$ coordinates and the centre $(u,v)$ coordinate. It is trivial to see on this 
figure that these separations are wider on longer baselines. The results of averaging is assigned to the centre $(u,v)$ coordinate coloured 
in red. 
\subsection{Methods}
\label{sec:baseline1}
In this section, we present the data compression algorithm we use to describe the weight of each sampled visibility during the 
integration time interval and and frequency interval. Now, let package the $(u,v)$ coordinates changes of a baseline $pq$ into a single 
matrix of size $n_t \times 2$.
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{U}_{pq,t}= \Bigg(\mathbf{u}_{pq,t_s}, \dots , \mathbf{u}_{pq,t_c}, \dots, \mathbf{u}_{pq,t_e}\Bigg)^T,
\end{equation}
where the indexes $s$, $c$ and $e$ references the integration interval starting, centre, and ending time respectively. The 
elements of $\mathbf{U}_{pq,t}$ are functions of time and frequency representing a $(u,v)$ coordinate. The frequency changes of the 
baseline coordinates can be package into a single vector of dimension $n_{\nu}$ 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \mbox{\boldmath $\nu$}&=&\Bigg(\nu_s,\dots,\nu_c,\dots,\nu_e\Bigg)^T
\end{eqnarray*}
We define a norm, $||\cdot||_{m}$ on a $n_t \times 2$ matrix as follow:
\begin{eqnarray}
||\textbf{U}_{pq,t}||_{m}=\Bigg(||\mathbf{u}_{pq,t_s}||, \dots , ||\mathbf{u}_{pq,t_c}||, \dots, ||\mathbf{u}_{pq,t_e}||\Bigg),
\end{eqnarray}
where $||.||$ is the Euclidean norm.
\begin{definition}[Time direction spacing]
\label{def:1}
The matrix that model the spacing between the $(u,v)$ coordinates and the centre $(u,v)$ coordinate of a baseline $(p,q)$ across the time 
direction is defined as
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \mathbf{U}_{pq,t}^{s} &=&\frac{\nu_c}{c}\cdot\Bigg\{\mathbf{U}_{pq,t}-\mathbf{H}_{pq,t} \Bigg \},
\end{eqnarray*}
where $c$ is the speed of the light and $\mathbf{H}_{pq}$ is a matrix of size $n_t \times 2$ that model the centre $uv$-coordinate,
$\mathbf{H}_{pq,t}= \big(\mathbf{u}_{pq,t_c}, \dots , \mathbf{u}_{pq,t_c}, \dots, \mathbf{u}_{pq,t_c}\big)^T$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Frequency direction spacing]
\label{def:2}
The vector of size $n_{\nu}$ that model the spacing between the $(u,v)$ coordinates and the centre $(u,v)$ coordinate of a baseline $(p,q)$ 
across the frequency direction is defined as
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{d}^{T}_{\nu} &=&\frac{||\textbf{u}_{pq,t_c}||}{c}\cdot\Bigg\{\mbox{\boldmath 
$\nu$}-\nu_c\cdot\mathbf{g}^T_{\nu} \Bigg \},
\end{eqnarray*}
where  $\textbf{g}$ is a $1\times n_{\nu}$ unity matrix.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Baseline dependent windowing function]

\section{Out FoV sources suppression algorithm}
\label{baseline2}
\subsection{Description}
In theory, windowing functions and signals generally extend to  infinity. Unfortunately, in practice, filtering a signal with a low pass 
filter, one need to define a cut-off interval. Therefore, if one  wants to achieve sufficiently an accurate  estimate of the 
windowing function ideal spectrum, one need a wide cut-off interval as far as the spectrum approaches the ideal when the windowing function 
order increases. An overlap baseline dependent windowing function aims to extend the order of the baseline dependent windowing function in 
such a way that, we approaches the ideal spectrum.
%, but by maintaining the same cut-off interval like the boxcar one. 
The only drawback of this technique is the increased of the time needed for processing the output sample of the signals being integrate.  
\subsection{Methods}
The weight of a visibility is not defined by a unique baseline dependent windowing, but by the strength of the correlation between the 
overall  overlapping baseline dependent windowing functions on the visibility. Now, consider that $f^{a}_{pq}$ is an overlap-\textit{BDWF} 
of width  $\Delta t$ and $\Delta \nu$ across the time and frequency direction respectively.
\begin{definition}[Baseline dependent windowing function]
\label{def:4}
if $\Delta_l t$ and $\Delta_l \nu$ are the overlap time interval and frequency interval of the baseline dependent windowing function  
$f_{pq}^{a_0}$ respectively  and $\Big\{f_{pq}^{a_1},f_{pq}^{a_2},f_{pq}^{a_3}, \dots \Big\}$ the set of \textit{BDWF} overlapping  on the 
\textit{left hand side} of $f_{pq}^{a_0}$ then the resulting \textit{BDWF} within $\Delta_l t$ and $\Delta_l \nu$ is defined as
\begin{eqnarray*}
 g^{lhs}_{pq}: \{\mathbf{\mathcal{R}},\mathbf{\mathcal{R}}\} &\rightarrow& \mathbf{\mathcal{R}}\\
                   d_{t_i},d_{\nu_j} &\mapsto& \frac{1}{N_{lhs}}\Bigg(\sum_{k}f_{pq,(d_{t_i},d_{\nu_j})}^{a_k} 
+ f_{pq,(d_{t_i},d_{\nu_j})}^{a_0}\Bigg).
\end{eqnarray*}
Here, $N_{lhs}$ is the normalization term defined as
\begin{eqnarray*}
N_{lhs}=\sum_{i=1}^{n_{lt}}\sum_{j=1}^{n_{l\nu}}\Bigg(\sum_{k}f_{pq,(d_{t_i},d_{\nu_j})}^{a_k} + f_{pq,(d_{t_i},d_{\nu_j})}^{a_0} \Bigg),
\end{eqnarray*}
where $n_{lt}$ and $n_{l\nu}$ are the number of $(u,v)$ coordinates changes and frequency changes  within $\Delta_l t$ and $\Delta_l \nu$ 
respectively.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Baseline dependent windowing function]
 \label{def:4}
 if $\Delta_r t$ and $\Delta_r \nu$ are the overlap time and frequency interval of a \textit{BDWF} $f_{pq}^{a_0}$ 
respectively and  $\Big\{f_{pq}^{a_1},f_{pq}^{a_2},f_{pq}^{a_3}, \dots \Big\}$ the set of \textit{BDWF} overlapping on the \textit{right 
hand side} of $f_{pq}^{a_0}$, then the 
resulting \textit{BDWF} within $\Delta_r t$ and $\Delta_r \nu$ is defined as
\begin{eqnarray*}
 g^{rhs}_{pq}: \{\mathbf{\mathcal{R}},\mathbf{\mathcal{R}}\} &\rightarrow& \mathbf{\mathcal{R}}\\
                   d_{t_i},d_{\nu_j} &\mapsto& 
\frac{1}{N_{rhs}}\Bigg (f_{pq,(d_{t_i},d_{\nu_j})}^{a_0}+\sum_{k}f_{pq,(d_{t_i},d_{\nu_j})}^{a_k}\Bigg ).
\end{eqnarray*}
Here, $N_{rhs}$ is the normalization term defined as
\begin{eqnarray*}
N_{rhs}=\sum_{i=1}^{n_{rt}}\sum_{j=1}^{n_{r\nu}}\Bigg(f_{pq,(d_{t_i},d_{\nu_j})}^{a_0} + \sum_{k}f_{pq,(d_{t_i},d_{\nu_j})}^{a_k}\Bigg),
\end{eqnarray*}
where $n_{rt}$ and $n_{r\nu}$ are the number of $(u,v)$ coordinates changes and frequency changes  within $\Delta_r t$ and $\Delta_r \nu$ 
respectively.
\end{definition}
From the above definitions, the following derivation is trivial 
\begin{equation*}
 \Big\{\Delta t,\hspace{0.17cm}\Delta \nu \Big\}=\Big\{\Delta_l t \cup \Delta_u t \cup \Delta_r t, \hspace{0.17cm}\Delta_l \nu \cup 
\Delta_u \nu \cup \Delta_r \nu \Big\},
\end{equation*}
where $\Delta_u t$ and $\Delta_u \nu$ are $f_{pq}^{a_0}$ uncorrelated time  and frequency interval respectively. They follows the below 
rules 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \Delta_u t= \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l}
     \cup\{t_i\}_{i=s',\hspace{0.1cm} s' \geq s+1}^{c', \hspace{0.1cm}c'\leq c-1} & \quad \text{if $n_{lt}+n_{rt}< n_t$}\\
      \{t_c\}& \quad \text{if $n_{lt}+n_{rt} = n_t$}\\
       \emptyset  & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right.
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \Delta_u \nu= \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l}
     \cup\{\nu_i\}_{i=s',\hspace{0.1cm} s'\geq s+1}^{c', \hspace{0.1cm}c'\leq c-1} & \quad \text{if $n_{l\nu}+n_{r\nu} < n_{\nu}$}\\
      \{\nu_c\}& \quad \text{if $n_{l\nu}+n_{r\nu} = n_{\nu}$}\\
       \emptyset  & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right.
\end{eqnarray*}
The resulting \textit{BDWF} becomes $g_{pq}$ described as
\begin{eqnarray*}
g_{pq} = \left\{ 
  \begin{array}{l l}
    g^{lhs}_{pq} & \quad \text{if $(t,\nu) \in (\Delta_l t, \Delta_l \nu)$}\\
    f^{a_0}_{pq} & \quad \text{if $(t,\nu) \in (\Delta_u t, \Delta_u \nu)$}\\
    g^{rhs}_{pq}& \quad \text{if $(t,\nu) \in (\Delta_r t, \Delta_r \nu)$}
  \end{array} \right.
\end{eqnarray*}
\subsection{Noise analysis}
The  overall rms noise is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sigma^2	&=& 
\frac{\sigma^{2}_{samp} }{N_{v}^{2}}\Big(\sum_{pq,k=1}^{N_{v}^{pq}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_t}\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\nu}}g_{pq,(dt_i,d\nu_j)}^{2}\Big) 
,\label{Equ:OBDWnoise}
\end{eqnarray*}
\subsection{Windowing functions}
\label{subsec:Windowing functions}
In signal processing a windowing function is a mathematical function that is zero-values outside of some chosen interval, and when another 
function or a signal is multiplied by the windowing function, the product is also zero-values outside the interval.
In this section, we evaluation the Peak Sidelobe Level (PSL), the Main 
Lobe width (MLW) and the Sidelobes Roll-off (SLR) of some windowing functions spectrum. This study will allow us to make 
a suitable choice of the window that by tapering with the sky, we conserve the brightness of sources in the field of 
interest and attenuate sidelobes confusion from strong sources out of the field of interest.
\subsubsection{Boxcar window: natural weighting}
This windowing function take a hunk of the data without modification, and  this leads to discontinuities at the edges\footnote{unless it 
happens that the signal  fit exactly with the windowing function width. Nevertheless, it is rare to find such a situation.}. For 
a cut-off frequency interval  $[-\nu_a,\nu_a]$ the boxcar windowing function is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{u}=\left\{
\begin{array}{rl}
1 & \mbox{$-\nu_a \leq \nu \leq \nu_a$} \\
0 & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
%and it Fourier transform is $\mathcal{F}^{-1}\big\{\Pi_{u}\big\}=sinc\big(\pi ||u(t/\lambda_a)|| l\big)$.\\
Fig.\ref{fig:fig_box} and Fig.\ref{fig:fig_box_freq} gives the graph of $\Pi_{u}$ and its spectrum respectively. The blue and 
the red curve of Fig.\ref{fig:fig_box_freq} are the spectrum of $\Pi_{u}$ for a frequency cut-off interval, $[-\nu_a,\nu_a]$ and 
$[-\nu_a/2,\nu_a/2]$ respectively. We noticed that when the cut-off interval is large, the MLW of the spectrum is 
narrower, the PSL is lower and the SLR drop faster. 
% The main lobe 
% extends from $-1/(2\nu_a)$ to $1/(2\nu_a)$, 
% beyond that the function oscillates at a constant rate while the amplitude gradually dies out. The larger the $\nu_a$, the narrower the 
% central peak and the oscillations.
\subsubsection{Gaussian window}
A Gaussian windowing function centred at mean zero with standard deviation, $\sigma$ can be described as 
\begin{equation}
  G_{u}= e^{-b\nu^{2}}.
\end{equation}
Here, $b=(2\sigma^2)^{-1}$ and  $\mathcal{F}^{-1}\big\{G_{u}\big\}=\sqrt{\frac{b}{\pi}}e^{-cl^2}$, where $c=\pi^2/b$.
This shows us that the inverse Fourier transform of a Gaussian with standard deviation $\sigma$ is a Gaussian with a standard 
deviation $\sigma '= (2\pi\sigma)^{-1}$. 

Fig.\ref{fig:fig_gauss} and Fig.\ref{fig:fig_gauss_freq} gives the graph of $G_{u}$ and its spectrum respectively, where $G_{u}$ 
is truncate within the cut-off frequency interval $[-\nu_a,\nu_a]$, with $b = 3$ for the blue curve and $b=5$ for the red one. We noticed 
that when the standard deviation is large, the MLW of the spectrum is narrower, the PSL is higher and the SLR drop slowly compare to a 
smaller standard deviation.
\subsubsection{Butterworth}
The frequency response of the Butterworth filter is flat  in the pass band, and rolls off towards zero in the stop band, and it is 
characterized by two independent parameters, the cut-off frequency 
$\nu_a$ and the order $p$. These two parameters controls the 
bandwidth and side lobes  attenuation. The frequency response of the Butterworth is given by 
\begin{equation}
B_u= \Big(1 + (\nu/\nu_a)^{2p}\Big)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
%Fig.\ref{fig:fig_butter} and Fig.\ref{fig:fig_butter_freq} gives the graph of $B_{u}$ and its spectrum respectively. 
For the same frequency interval $[-\nu_a,\nu_a]$, we plotted  three curves $\{p=1, p=3, p=5\}$ of $B_{u}$ in Fig.\ref{fig:fig_butter} and 
their corresponding spectrum in Fig.\ref{fig:fig_butter_freq}.  We noticed 
that when the other $p$ is getting bigger, the MLW of the spectrum is conserved, while the PSL is getting higher and the SLR is 
dropping  faster.
\subsubsection{Bessel Function of the First Kind}
\subsubsection{First order prolate spheroidal wave function}
\subsubsection{Sinc window}
In theory, the sinc window  is an infinitely large convolution filter as it is non zero everywhere, and its inverse Fourier
Transform produces the ideal filter kernel (the boxcar windowing function). The sinc is defined as follow:
\begin{equation}
S_u= sinc\big(\pi bu(t/\lambda_a)\big).
\end{equation}
However, in practice some one need to defined a cut-off interval where the window is considered to be non zero, and zero out of this 
cut-off interval. Fig.\ref{fig:fig_sinc} and Fig.\ref{fig:fig_sinc_freq} gives the graph of $S_{u}$ and its spectrum respectively, where 
$S_{u}$ is truncate within the cut-off frequency interval $[-\nu_a,\nu_a]$. We noticed that when the cut-off frequency interval is large 
(Fig.\ref{fig:fig_sinc_freq}, blue curve), the spectrum becomes perfectly flat at the passband while the MLW becomes narrower,  the PSL 
becomes lower and the SLR drop faster compare to a cut-off frequency of $[-\nu_a,\nu_a]$ (Fig.\ref{fig:fig_sinc_freq}, red curve). \\
\begin{tabular}{*3{c}}
 \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{}\\
 \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
  \footnotesize Windows &\textbf{\footnotesize MLL (-3db)}&\textbf{\footnotesize PSL (db)} &\textbf{\footnotesize SLR (db/octave) }  \\

  \end{tabular}& \label{BDWBnoise}
\end{tabular}\\
A windowing function with a narrower main lobe width for a better spectral resolution, lower PSL to have less
masking of nearby sources, and faster SLR to have less masking for far away sources  is preferably in this work. 
Nevertheless, The energy is more concentrated in the frequency domain main lobe when the  lobe width is narrower. Therefore, the frequency 
domain of the boxcar  and the Butterworth window look similar, but the other of the Butterworth frequency domain can be control with the 
goal to concentrate more energy in the frequency main lobe. However, the  sinc window is preferable as we expect in this work, signals in a 
wide dynamic range.
\subsubsection{Noise  and comparison}
The methods described in section (\ref{baseline1}) and section (\ref{baseline2}) are use in this subsection to evaluate the 
theoretical noise, $f_{pq}$ and $g_{pq}$ are replaced in  Eq.\ref{Equ:BDWnoise} and 
Eq.\ref{Equ:OBDWnoise} respectively by the windowing functions described above. Table (\ref{BDWBnoise}) and 
(\ref{OBDWBnoise}) summarize the theoretical noise where these functions are used as a baseline dependent 
windowing and as an overlap baseline dependent windowing functions respectively. \\

$1.)$ In Figures (\ref{fig1}) and (\ref{fig2}) we represented the ratio $\frac{\sigma_{meas,pq}}{\sigma_{av,pq}}$ as a function 
of $\sum_{i}^{n} u_i((t_c-t_i)/\lambda))$ ($\sigma_{meas,pq},\sigma_{av,pq}$ are the per baselines CWF and averaging rms noise  
respectively). We could also represented it as a function of baseline length. But, a uv-track corresponding to baseline aligned along the 
Est-West direction has longer tracts compare to one aligned along the South-Nordth for the same integration and frequency band. Therefore,  
$\frac{\sigma_{meas,pq}}{\sigma_{av,pq}}$ $v/s$ baselines length is ambiguous. We consider five baselines dependent 
windowing sinc function, $Bl$-$sinc$ $wk$ (with an extended width of $(k-1)n$ time intervals and/or frequency channels and $k \geq 1$). The 
experiment is done for two cases, figure (\ref{fig1}) is the one for $Bl$-$sinc$ $wk$ over both time-frequency and figure (\ref{fig2}) over 
time. These figures shows that, the noise increases with baselines length.\\
$2.)$ Figure (\ref{fig1}) shows that, with $Bl$-$sinc$ $wk$, the noise is lower on shorter baselines compared to the longer baselines. This 
is because on shorter  baselines  $\frac{\sigma_{meas,pq}}{\sigma_{av,pq}} \approx \frac{n}{n + k}$, it is the same case with 
Figure (\ref{fig2}) where $\frac{\sigma_{meas,pq}}{\sigma_{av,pq}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{n}{n + k}}$ (see the proof).  With $Bl$-$Sinc$ $wk$ 
($k>1$), the noise drops  with the extended number of time intervals and/or frequency channels of 
the window. The rate of this drop is non-linear with baselines length and also with the overlap time interval and/or frequency channels 
(see figure (\ref{fig1}b) and (\ref{fig2}b), the variation of the noise rate between baselines).  \\
$3.)$ In spite of the overlapping, with the theoretical results, the noise of longer baselines do not drop when the overlap 
samples is increased (figure \ref{fig2}). The reason is, few windows are overlapping in a visibility point when we extended in a unique 
direction (the time interval in this case) compare to two directions (time interval and frequency channels). 
The theoretical derivation for the overall noise of $Bl$-$sinc$ $wk$ and the simulated one are quantified similarly but the pattern of the  
per baseline simulated rms noise do not look the same with the theoretical one. The number of $k$ determines the amount of noise  of CWF.
\section{Simulations and results}
In order to test the algorithms described in section and section, we performed  multiple tests on JVLA simulated measurement sets (MS). In 
this section we summarize and discussed those results. Several windowing functions  were described in the previous
section, the sinc window 
and the Bessel of the first kind approaches well our specifications, and they are taken under consideration. Two MS is used in 
our simulation, a high resolution MS (HR-MS) that contained the observed JVLA data of short integration time and frequency, a low resolution 
MS (LR-MS), where the simple averaged or the weight averaged data are saved. To apply the second algorithm described in section 
\ref{baseline2}, the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If $t^{hrms}_{start}$ and $t^{lrms}_{start}$ are the starting time of the HR-MS and LR-MS respectively. $n_{t,ovlp}$ the number 
of timeslots extended across the time direction, and  $\Delta t^{hrms}$ the HR-MS integration time, then 
      %\begin{eqnarray*}
	    $t^{lrms}_{start}\geq t^{hrms}_{start} + n_{t,ovlp}\times \Delta t^{hrms}$. 
      %\end{eqnarray*}
  \item If $t^{hrms}_{end}$ and $t^{lrms}_{end}$ are the ending time of the HR-MS and LR-MS respectively, then 
      %\begin{eqnarray*}
	    $t^{lrms}_{end}\leq t^{hrms}_{end} + n_{t,ovlp}\times \Delta t^{hrms}$. 
      %\end{eqnarray*}
 \item If $\nu^{hrms}_{start}$ and $\nu^{lrms}_{start}$ are the starting frequency of the HR-MS and LR-MS respectively. $n_{\nu,ovlp}$ 
the number of channels extended across the frequency direction, and  $\Delta \nu^{hrms}$ the HR-MS width, then 
      %\begin{eqnarray*}
	    $\nu^{lrms}_{start} \geq \nu^{hrms}_{start} + n_{\nu,ovlp}\times \Delta \nu^{hrms}$. 
      %\end{eqnarray*}
 \item If $\nu^{hrms}_{end}$ and $\nu^{lrms}_{end}$ are the ending frequency of the HR-MS and LR-MS respectively, then 
      %\begin{eqnarray*}
	    $\nu^{lrms}_{end} \leq \nu^{hrms}_{end} + n_{\nu,ovlp}\times \Delta \nu^{hrms}$. 
      %\end{eqnarray*}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Smearing elimination and out FoV suppression}
We considered $40$ sky models of 1Jy source, the sky models differ from each other by the source coordinates. However, the 
reason of having a unique source in the sky model is to avoid interferences that can cost calibration artefacts in the sky 
maps \citep{Grobler2014} which 
can affect the brightness of these sources. Another obvious effect is the  CLEAN algorithm \citep{Grobler2014} that does not clean the 
dirty map at 100\%, therefore we need to avoid flux distribution between sources via their sidelobes. Each of the sky model is simulated 
with a JVLA HR-MS of 7min30s snapshot synthesis, with a $\Delta t^{hrms}=1.5s$ integration 
time at 1.4GHz,  with 150 channels of width $\Delta \nu^{hrms}$=125kHz. We therefore applied the actual method (simple averaging) and 
our methods, each result is save into a LR-MS of 1min30s synthesis, with a 150s integration time,  with 1 channels of width 6.25MHz. We 
considered, $\{t^{hrms}_{start},\nu^{hrms}_{start}\}=\{0s,125kHz\}$, $\{t^{lrms}_{start},\nu^{lrms}_{start}\}=\{1min30s,6250kHz\}$, 
$\{t^{hrms}_{end},\nu^{hrms}_{end}\}=\{7min30s$,xxxkHz\}, $\{t^{lrms}_{end},\nu^{lrms}_{end}\}=\{6min,xxxkHz\}$, $n_{t,ovlp}=\{0,100,150\}$ 
and $n_{\nu,ovlp}=\{0,25,50\}$.\\
Fig.\ref{fig:Bl-sinc-FoV2}, Fig.\ref{fig:Bl-sinc-FoV4}, Fig.\ref{fig:Bl-bessel-FoV2} and Fig.\ref{fig:Bl-bessel-FoV4} show the results of 
the simulation, where we represented the brightness of the source as a function of the source coordinates in the sky. In these figures, we 
considered three cases of the sinc window, and three of the Bessel first kind ($Bl$-$sinc$ $W n_{t,ovlp} \times n_{\nu,ovlp}$, $Bl$-J$_0$ 
$W n_{t,ovlp} \times n_{\nu,ovlp}$ with  $n_{t,ovlp}=\{0,100,150\}$ and $n_{\nu,ovlp}=\{0,25,50\}$). We evaluated the loss in signal 
amplitude with longer LR-MS integration time interval $\Delta t^{lrms}=150s$ and wider LR-MS integration frequency interval $\Delta 
\nu^{lrms}=6250kHz$. We furthermore evaluated the  noise ratio, $\mathcal{R}_{\sigma}=\frac{\sigma_{w}}{\sigma_{Avg}}$ (with $\sigma_{w}$  
the resulting noise of the filter under consideration and $\sigma_{Avg}$ the noise of simple averaging).\\
% $r$: source position in degrees.}
These results shows that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item We measured more than $90\%$ of the source brightness within $\approx 75\%$ of the FoV using $Bl$-$sinc$ $W0 \times 0$ and 
      $Bl$-J$_0$ $W0\times0$. Unfortunately, the attenuation rate of the source out of the FoV is approximately the same when performing 
with simple averaging.
 \item We measured more than $90\%$ of the source brightness within $\approx 95\%$ of the FoV with the overlap filters. However, as mention 
in section \ref{subsec:Windowing functions} the reason for this is that, the overlap filter is an accurate practical evaluation of the 
window theoretical representation\footnote{windowing function theoretically extend to infinitely}. 
 \item Another obvious effect of the overlap filters is the suppression of the source when this source is out of the FoV. When
looking at these figures, it appears that the curves of the overlaps filters are below the one of simple averaging.  However, the overlaps 
filters attenuated $\approx 99\%$ of the source brightness out of the FoV.
  \item  When
looking at these figures, it appears that the sinc window conserved the signal within the FoV compared to the Bessel of the 
first kind window, while the Bessel of the first kind suppressed the signal out of the FoV compare to the sinc. However, the reason for 
this is that
the main lobe width of the sinc is narrower than the one of the Bessel first kind and the Bessel first kind has low 
sidelobes level compared to the sinc.
\end{itemize}
When performing the baseline dependent filters, smearing is eliminated within the FoV while we compressed 
the data by integrating over a large time interval and wider frequency interval of a LR-MS. However, under some assumptions,
the overlap baseline dependent filters significantly attenuate the source  out of the FoV  to a greater extent than simple averaging. Thus,
in all cases the SNR obtained using these methods are greater than the one using the simple averaging method even as there is loss in 
sensitivity.
\subsection{Maximal integration}
In this section, the maximal frequency and time integration that can be consider in the frequency direction and the time 
direction without smearing in the FoV while the methods accurately suppressed the source when this is out of the FoV is evaluated. However, 
we considered $6$ sky models of a 1Jy source with different coordinates ($r=\{0.09^\circ,0.25^\circ,0.5^\circ,1^\circ,1.5^\circ, 
2^\circ\}$). The methods are performed with a $2^\circ$ FoV sinc and Bessel first kind filters centered in the phase centre.
\subsubsection{Frequency direction}
In this case, each of these sky model is simulated with a JVLA HR-MS of 1 timeslots synthesis, with a short integration time of $\Delta 
t^{hrms}=0.1s$ at 1.4GHz. The aims of a short HR-MS integration time is to avoid time direction smearing and therefore accurately evaluate
smearing in the frequency direction. We considered 150 channels, and varied the width, $\Delta \nu^{hrms}$ in the interval $[125,1187.5]$ 
kHz.   We therefore applied the actual method 
(simple averaging) and our methods both in the frequency direction, each result is save into a LR-MS of 1 timeslot synthesis, with 0.1s 
integration time and 1 channels of width $\Delta \nu^{hrms}\times50$ kHz. We considered, $\nu^{hrms}_{start}=\Delta \nu^{hrms}kHz$, 
$\nu^{lrms}_{start}=\nu^{hrms}_{start}\times50 kHz$, $\nu^{hrms}_{end}=\nu^{hrms}_{start}\times150 kHz$ and 
$\nu^{lrms}_{end}=\nu^{hrms}_{start}\times100 kHz$.\\
We compared in Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-freq-sinc-w1x1-fov2} and Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-freq-sinc-w1x50-fov2}  the results of simple 
frequency averaging and the one of  $Bl$-$sinc$ $W n_{\nu,ovlp}$ performed in the frequency direction. We compared in 
Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-freq-bessel-w1x1-fov2} and Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-freq-bessel-w1x50-fov2} the results of simple 
frequency averaging and the one of  $Bl$-J$_0$ $W n_{\nu,ovlp}$. Here we took $n_{\nu,ovlp}=\{0,50\}$ frequency overlap bins. These results 
shows that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Firstly, these results show that, we can significantly integrate over a wider LR-MS frequency interval without a lost of signal 
amplitude. However, looking at these figures, the curves of the source at $0.09^{\circ},0.25^{\circ},0.5^{\circ}$ from the phase centre are 
closer to the affine equation $y=1$, which differ from the curves when the source is at $1^{\circ},1.5^{\circ}, 2^{\circ}$ from the phase 
centre.  
 \item Secondly, looking on Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-freq-sinc-w1x50-fov2} and 
\ref{fig:max-integ-freq-bessel-w1x50-fov2}, when the source is at $1.5^{\circ}$ and $2^{\circ}$, the attenuation is significant within 
$[6.2,12.6]MHz$ with the overlap frequency direction filters compare to simple frequency averaging.
 \item Finally, the sinc filter performed well on signal recovery compare to the Bessel first kind and the Bessel first kind suppressed the 
source when this is out of the FoV compare to the sinc.  
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Time direction}
In this case, each of these sky model is simulated with a JVLA HR-MS of $300$ timeslots synthesis, and we varied the integration time 
$\Delta t^{hrms}$ in the interval $[0.5,5.5]$s at 1.4GHz. We considered 1 channels of width, $\Delta \nu^{hrms}=125kHz$.   We 
therefore applied the actual method (simple averaging) and our methods both in the time direction then the result of each simulation is 
saved into a LR-MS of $100\times\Delta t^{hrms}s$ synthesis, with a $100\times\Delta t^{hrms}s$ integration time, with 1 channels of width 
$125kHz$. We considered, $t^{hrms}_{start}=0s$, $t^{lrms}_{start}=100$timeslots$\times\Delta t^{hrms} s$, 
$t^{hrms}_{end}=300$timeslots$\times\Delta t^{hrms}s$ and $t^{lrms}_{end}=200$timeslots$\times\Delta t^{hrms}s$.\\
We compared in Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-time-sinc-w1x1-fov2} and Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-time-sinc-w100x1-fov2}  the results of simple 
time averaging and the one of  $Bl$-$sinc$ $W n_{t,ovlp}$ performed in the time direction. We compared in 
Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-time-bessel-w1x1-fov2} and Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-time-bessel-w100x1-fov2} the results of simple time averaging 
and the one of  $Bl$-J$_0$ $W n_{t,ovlp}$. Here, we took $n_{t,ovlp}=\{0,100\}$ time overlap bins. These results 
shows that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Firstly, these results show that, we can significantly integrate over a wider LR-MS frequency interval without a lost of signal 
amplitude. However, looking at these figures, the curves of the source at $0.09^{\circ},0.25^{\circ},0.5^{\circ}$ from the phase centre are 
closer to the affine equation $y=1$, which differ from the curves when the source is at $1^{\circ},1.5^{\circ}, 2^{\circ}$ from the phase 
centre.  
 \item Secondly, looking on Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-freq-sinc-w1x50-fov2} and 
\ref{fig:max-integ-freq-bessel-w1x50-fov2}, when the source is at $1.5^{\circ}$ and $2^{\circ}$, the attenuation is significant within 
$[6.2,12.6]MHz$ with the overlap frequency direction filters compare to simple frequency averaging.
 \item Finally, the sinc filter performed well on signal recovery compare to the Bessel first kind and the Bessel first kind suppressed the 
source when this is out of the FoV compare to the sinc.  
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\subsubsection{Time and frequency direction}
In this case, each sky model is simulated with a JVLA HR-MS of $300$ timeslots synthesis, and varied  the integration time $\Delta 
t^{hrms}$ in $[0.5,5.5]s$ at $1.4GHz$.  We considered $150$ channels and varied the width $\Delta \nu^{hrms}$  within the interval $[ 
125.,750.]kHz$. We therefore applied the actual method (simple averaging) and our methods both in the frequency direction and time 
direction, each result is save into a LR-MS of  $100$timeslots$\times\Delta t^{hrms}s$ synthesis, with $100$timeslots$\times\Delta 
t^{hrms}$ integration time and 1 channels of width $50$channels$\times\Delta \nu^{hrms}kHz$. We considered, $t^{hrms}_{start}=0s$, 
$t^{lrms}_{start}=100$timeslots$\times\Delta t^{hrms} s$, $t^{hrms}_{end}=300$timeslots$\times\Delta t^{hrms}s$ and 
$t^{lrms}_{end}=200$timeslots$\times\Delta t^{hrms}s$, $\nu^{hrms}_{start}=\Delta \nu^{hrms}kHz$, 
$\nu^{lrms}_{start}=\nu^{hrms}_{start}\times50 kHz$, $\nu^{hrms}_{end}=\nu^{hrms}_{start}\times150 kHz$ and 
$\nu^{lrms}_{end}=\nu^{hrms}_{start}\times100 kHz$.\\ 
We compared in Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-timefreq-sinc-w1x1-fov2} and Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-timefreq-sinc-w100x50-fov2}  the results of 
simple time and frequency averaging and the one of  $Bl$-$sinc$ $W n_{t,ovlp}\times n_{\nu,ovlp}$ performed in the time and frequency 
direction. We compared in Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-timefreq-bessel-w1x1-fov2} and Fig.\ref{fig:max-integ-timefreq-bessel-w100x50-fov2} the 
results of simple time and frequency averaging and the one of  $Bl$-J$_0$ $W n_{t,ovlp}\times n_{\nu,ovlp}$ performed in the time and 
frequency direction. Here, we took $n_{t,ovlp}=\{0,100\}$ time overlap bins and $n_{\nu,ovlp}=\{0,50\}$ frequency overlap bins. These 
results shows that:
\begin{itemize}
 \item We measured more than 90\% of the source brightness within $\approx 75\%$ of the FoV with $Bl$-$sinc$ $W0 \times 0$ and 
      $Bl$-J$_0$ $W0\times0$. 
 \item We measured more than 90\% of the source brightness within $\approx 95\%$ of the FoV with the overlap filters ($Bl$-$sinc$ 
     $W n_{t,ovlp} \times n_{\nu,ovlp}$, $Bl$-J$_0$ $W n_{t,ovlp} \times n_{\nu,ovlp}$).
 \item We loss $\approx 99\%$ of the source brightness when the source is $\approx 1^{\circ}$ away from the FoV when using the overlap 
filters.
  \item The sinc window conserved the signal within the FoV compared to the Bessel of the first kind window, while the Bessel of the first 
kind suppressed the signal out of the FoV compare to the sinc.
\end{itemize}
This suggest that, smearing is eliminated within the FoV when we compressed the data by integrating over large time interval and wider 
bandwidth and the FoV can therefore be extended according on the science goals.

\section[]{Derivation of complex matrices}
The matrix $\mathcal{\textbf{W}}_{pq,(t,\nu)}$ is of size $n_t \times n_{\nu}$ and contained the weights of the baseline $(p,q)$ 
visibilities points.
The convolution operator is linear, therefore we can rewrite Eq.\ref{f4} in terms of a series of linear transformations as follow:
\begin{equation}
V_{pq}^{corr}= \mathbf{C}_{(t,\nu)}^{block}\cdot\mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block}\cdot \mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block}$ is a block diagonal matrix of size $(4n_t n_{\nu})\times(4n_t n_{\nu})$ defined as follow:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{C}_{(t,\nu)}^{block}=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{c}_{(t,\nu)} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 &  \mathbf{c}_{(t,\nu)} &0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \mathbf{c}_{(t,\nu)} & 0\\
      0 & 0 & 0 & \mathbf{c}_{(t,\nu)}\\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Here, $\mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block}$ is a block diagonal matrix of size $(4n_t n_{\nu})\times(4n_t n_{\nu})$ defined as follow:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block}=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}& 0 & 0 & 0\\
    0 &  \mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)} &0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)} & 0\\
      0 & 0 & 0 & \mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}\\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp}&=&\Bigg[\mathcal{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{0},\mathcal{ V } 
^1_{pq,(t,\nu)},\mathcal{V}^2_{pq,(t,\nu)},\mathcal{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{3 } \Bigg]^T. 
\end{eqnarray*}
For a synthesis, the baseline $(p,q)$ made a full coverage in the $(u,v)$ plane. Therefore, we can  
package into a single matrix, $\mathbf{V}_{pq,}^{avg}$ of size $(4N_t N_{\nu})\times (4N_t N_{\nu})$ the 
weighted average visibilities of the  baseline $(p,q)$ during the synthesis as follows: 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{V}_{pq}^{corr}=\mathbf{C}_{(t,\nu)}^{block,n}\cdot\mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block,n}\cdot \mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp,n}.
\end{equation}
where $N_t$ and  $N_{\nu}$ are the number of time sample and frequency channels entering the Fourier domain. If the synthesis time is $T$ 
and the frequency range is $F$, then $T=N_t \times \Delta t$ and $F=N_{\nu}\times\Delta \nu$. The the size of 
$\mathbf{V}_{pq}^{avg}$ can also be written as $(4N_v^{pq})\times (4N_v^{pq})$, where $N_v^{pq}$ is the 
number of time and frequency visibilities for the baseline $(p,q)$). The matrix $\mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block,n}$ is a diagonal block 
matrix of size $(4N_v^{pq}n_t n_{\nu})\times (4N_v^{pq}n_t n_{\nu})$ defined as follow:
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block,n}=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block} &\dots & 0 & \dots & 0\\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
    0 & \dots& \mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block} &\dots & 0\\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    0 & \dots& 0 &\dots & \mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block}\\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{C}_{(t,\nu)}^{block,n}=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{C}_{(t,\nu)}^{block} &\dots & 0 & \dots & 0\\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\

\end{equation*}
The sampled visibilities $\mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp,n}$ is a one row matrix of size 
$(N_v^{pq}4 n_t n_{\nu})\times (4 n_t n_{\nu})$ made of $\textbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp}$ on top of each other. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp,n}&=&\Bigg[\mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp},\dots, \mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp}, \dots,
\mathbf{V}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{samp}\Bigg]^T. 
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{V}_{pq}^{avg}= \mathbf{W}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{block,n}\cdot 
\mathbf{S}_{pq,(t,\nu)}^{n}\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathcal{I}_{l,m}^{sky},\label{eqv:linear}
\end{equation}
if the number of pixel in the sky model is $N_{pix}$, then the true sky image vector $\mathcal{I}_{l,m}^{sky}$ has a size of $4N_{pix}$ and 
$\textbf{F}$ is the Fourier transform operator of size $(4N_{pix})\times(4N_{pix})$.
We are generally interested in using the total set of visibilities over baselines, time and frequencies, having $4\times N_v$ visibilities 
measured over all baselines  and $N_v=n_{bl}\times N_v^{pq}$ in this case. Here, $n_{bl}$ is the number of baseline. We can write
\begin{equation}
 \mathbf{V}_{all}^{avg}=\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathcal{I}_{l,m}^{sky}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\mathbf{A}$ is a matrix of size $(4N_v)\times (4N_{pix})$ defined as follow
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{A}_{l,m}=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{C}_{(t,\nu)}^{block,n}\cdot \mathbf{W}_{01,(t,\nu)}^{block,n}\cdot \mathbf{S}_{01,(t,\nu)}^{block,n} \cdot\mathbf{F}\\
    \vdots\\
    \mathbf{C}_{(t,\nu)}^{block,n}\cdot \mathbf{W}_{ik,(t,\nu)}^{block,n}\cdot \mathbf{S}_{ik,(t,\nu)}^{block,n} \cdot\mathbf{F}\\
    \vdots \\
    \mathbf{C}_{(t,\nu)}^{block,n}\cdot \mathbf{W}_{jl,(t,\nu)}^{block,n}\cdot \mathbf{S}_{jl,(t,\nu)}^{block,n} \cdot\mathbf{F}\\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
The 
dirty image, $\mathcal{I}_{l,m}^{D}$ of size $4N_{pix}$ can then be derived
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{I}_{l,m}^{D}=\mathbf{F}^{H}\cdot\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathcal{I}_{l,m}^{sky}.
\end{equation}
Here, $H$ represents the the conjugate transpose operation also known as a Hermitian transpose and $\mathbf{F}^{H}$ is the inverse 
Fourier transform operator of size $(4N_{pix})\times(4N_{pix})$.
\section[]{Similar way of imaging}
We explained how we derived the complex matrices used in section \ref{sec:imaging}
Each baseline has his own baseline dependent windowing functions during integration. Unfortunately, we can not accurately estimate the 
resulting spectrum of all windowing functions that multiply the sky seen by these baselines (if we supposed that all baselines are seen the 
same sky). The measured sky intensity of the array is derived from the inverse Fourier transform of the sum of the sample visibilities 
measured at each baseline. The mathematics behind this is as follow:
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \mathcal{I}^{D}_{l,m}&=&\mathcal{F}^{-1}\Bigg\{\sum_{pq}\mathcal{S}_{pq}\cdot \Bigg(c_{pq}\cdot\big(\mathcal{W}_{pq}\circ 
\mathcal{V}\big)\Bigg)_{(t,\nu)}\Bigg\}
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\mathcal{S}_{pq}$ is the sampling function of the baseline $pq$.  This can be rewritten as
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \mathcal{I}^{D}_{l,m}&=&\sum_{pq}\mathcal{B}_{pq}\circ \Bigg(\mathcal{F}^{-1}\big\{c\big\}_{pq}\circ\big(\mathcal{R}_{pq}\cdot
\mathcal{I}^{sky}\big)\Bigg)_{(l,m)}
\end{eqnarray*}
Here, $\mathcal{R}_{pq}=\mathcal{W}_{pq}$ is the sky response or smearing response for the baseline $pq$. The same sky seen by all 
baselines is $\mathcal{I}^{sky}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{pq}$ is the synthesized beam or point spread function of the baseline $pq$. 
$\Bigg(\mathcal{F}^{-1}\big\{c\big\}_{pq}\circ\big(\mathcal{R}_{pq}\cdot \mathcal{I}^{sky}\big)\Bigg)_{(l,m)}= 
\big(\mathcal{R}_{pq}\cdot\mathcal{I}^{sky}\big)_{(l,m)}$. Therefore, the dirty beam can be written as: 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \mathcal{I}^{D}_{l,m}&=&\Bigg(\sum_{pq}\mathcal{B}_{pq}\circ \bigg(\mathcal{R}_{pq}\cdot
\mathcal{I}\bigg)\Bigg)_{(l,m)}
\end{eqnarray*}
If the integration windowing function were the same in all baseline, then we can write:
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \mathcal{I}^{D}_{l,m}&=&\Bigg(\bigg(\sum_{pq}\mathcal{B}_{pq}\bigg)\circ \bigg(\mathcal{R}\cdot
\mathcal{I}\bigg)\Bigg)_{(l,m)}
\end{eqnarray*}
