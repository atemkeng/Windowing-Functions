We used 9 EVN GROUND-BASED stations :

EF, HH, JB, NT, ON, TR, YS, WB, SH. The longest baseline here is ~10161Km and the shortest baseline is
~267m. 

We sampled the uv domain at 0.01s during 1s at 16GHz resulting to 100 timeslots. Each timeslots has a total bandwidth of 12500.Hz channelized into 25 channels each of width 500Hz.
