We used 9 EVN GROUND-BASED stations :

EF, HH, JB, NT, ON, TR, YS, WB, SH. The longest baseline here is ~10161Km and the shortest baseline is
~267Km. 

We sampled the uv domain during 0.001s time step during a period  5.5s at 16GHz, this resulting to  5500 timeslots. Each timeslots has a total bandwidth of 161.0KHz channelized into 322 channels each of width 500Hz.
